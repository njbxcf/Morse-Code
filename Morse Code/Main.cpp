/*

Plan 
------------------------------------
1. Main asks the user if they want to decode morse code or encode to morse code

2. Tree Header will build the morse tree = Write a function that builds the morse tree shown in the figure above. The
information of the tree (the letters and the codes) is stored in a txt file. Use a binary search tree or a map to store the codes for letters.

	//cin.get() morse.txt file

3. For Encoding: ab = .-

Call the binary search tree or map. Compare the morse nodes and print the English alphabet

4. For Decoding: .- = ab
Call the binary search tree or map. Compare the English Aplhabet and print the morse nodes 
See the project as there is an explaination somewhere on the PDF. ~~~~
Notice that between the symbols (dots and dashes) is a space. The space is a delimiter that separates the codes for letters.
